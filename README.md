MTI Stack

We consider this a bare minimum to gather data from IOT devices.
Mosquitto - message broker from Eclipse for MQTT real time communication
Telegraf - agent to collect data from the broker and write them to the DB
InfluxDB - time series database that also provides a nice interface to visualise the data
